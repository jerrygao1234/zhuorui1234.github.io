      <p>
        I like dogs, all kinds of them. It is pleasure for me to actually see
        the happy face of dogs and I also feel enjoyable playing with the dogs.
        Every time I see the dogs run to me from the grass land; every time I
        see the dogs sleep in my arm quietly; every time I see the dogs enjoy
        the meal with their tails swiling happily, I feel that all the efforts
        and energy I put on the dogs worth it. Here are some pictures of my
        dog. And I guess it would be a blog for the dog for recording the daily
        life of this puppy. All the post inside is written by me but with the
        perspective of the dog. All the pictures on this site are taken by myself.

        person, he gives me food, play with me, teach me simple move."
